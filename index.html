            <br>
            <p>
                Vincent Yang (or Vince) loves technology. At only the age of 10, ever since "helping" his cousin build a computer for a family member, Vince knew that his future was in tech. From designing fiber optic cable infrastructure, engineering 5G cell towers, building computers, repairing and restoring cell-phones, to cable management: he's had a hand in it. Vince is currently a student in Georgia Tech's coding Boot Camp program.
